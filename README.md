# CERN_Co-op
Collection of code from my 2018 Co-op at CERN/CMS through Dr. Orimoto and Northeastern University

# DtPlotter:
Code for studying timing resolution in ECAL crystals from the June2018 test beam data.

# AutoHadd.py:
A script to automatically run hadd commands on reconstructed root files from Simone Pigazzini's H4Analysis repo, especially from the SubmitBatch.py script. Very conveniently handles consistent file naming, and sorting runs by position and energy from the info TTree.

Run as: "python AutoHadd.py /path/to/files (frequency) (temperature)"

# ViceTools:
Tools for controlling vice boards for testing VFE and FE components and ECAL data streams.
